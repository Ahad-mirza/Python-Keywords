#🚀 Overview

This program demonstrates the use of conditional statements (if, elif, else) in Python through a variety of practical examples:

User Authentication 🔐

Temperature Check 🌡️

Income Tax Calculation 💰

Day Classification 📅

Driving License Eligibility 🚗

📚 About if, elif, and else

if: Executes a block of code if the condition is true.

elif: Short for "else if," checks another condition if the previous one is false.

else: Executes a block of code if none of the previous conditions are true.
