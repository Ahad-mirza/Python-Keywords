1. Login Verification System 🔐
Problem:
Write a Python program that takes a username and password as input and checks whether they match predefined credentials. If they match, print "Login Successful!"; otherwise, print "Invalid credentials."

Answer:

python
Copy code
name = input("Enter Username: 🧑‍💻")
pass_input = int(input("Enter password for Login🔑: "))
password = 78047340

if pass_input == password:
    if name == "Ahad":
        print("Login Successful! 🔓")
else:
    print("Invalid credentials ❌")
2. Temperature Advice System 🌡️
Problem:
Create a program that prompts the user to input the current temperature. Based on the temperature, provide advice:

If the temperature is 30°C or above, suggest staying hydrated.
If the temperature is between 20°C and 30°C, suggest going for a walk.
If the temperature is below 20°C, suggest wearing a jacket.
Answer:

python
Copy code
temp = int(input("Enter the current temperature: 🌡️"))

if temp >= 30:
    print("You need to stay hydrated 💧.")
elif 20 < temp < 30:
    print("It's a nice day for a walk 🚶‍♂️.")
else:
    print("Wear a jacket to keep warm 🧥.")
3. Tax Rate Calculator 💰
Problem:
Write a program that calculates the tax rate based on the user's annual income:

If income is less than or equal to 50,000, the tax rate is 10%.
If income is greater than 50,000 but less than or equal to 100,000, the tax rate is 20%.
If income is greater than 100,000, the tax rate is 30%.
Answer:

python
Copy code
income = int(input("Enter your annual income: 💸"))

if income <= 50000:
    print("Your tax rate is 10% 💵")
elif 50000 < income <= 100000:
    print("Your tax rate is 20% 💰")
else:
    print("Your tax rate is 30% 🤑")
4. Day Type Checker 📅
Problem:
Develop a Python script that asks the user for a day of the week. Based on the input, determine whether it's a weekday or a weekend.

Answer:

python
Copy code
day = str(input("Enter the day of the week: 📅"))

if day.lower() == "saturday" or day.lower() == "sunday":
    print("It's the weekend! 🎉")
else:
    print("It's a weekday. 📚")
5. Driving License Eligibility 🚗

If the user is older than 16 but younger than or equal to 18, print "You need parental consent to get a driving license."
If the user is older than 18, print "You are eligible to get a driving license."
Answer:

python
Copy code
age = int(input("Enter your age! 👶"))

if age <= 16:
    print("You are too young to get a driving license. 🚫")
elif 16 < age <= 18:
    print("You need parental consent to get a driving license. 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦")
else:
    print("You are eligible to get a driving license. 🚗")
